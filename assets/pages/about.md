This website contains select images from my archive of over 60,000 photographs taken from 2004 to the present day.

If I could describe the type of photographer I am, I would say I am enthusiast who keeps at it - constantly taking the camera out, experimenting, reading, learning and producing.

I don't do this in any professional capacity - mainly an expensive hobby. I take my camera with me wherever I go because there is always something interesting happening. The trick is to keep going out and keep shooting.

## Motivation

I wanted to build something so I could show the world my photography. I wanted to show my work on my terms in a setting I feel comfortable with - something I have built myself.

The other motivation for building this was to delve more into the world of [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) - a static site generator which uses React.

## Me
I'm from Dublin in Ireland and photography has been a passion of mine for almost twenty years. I have lived in Berlin, London and Toulouse in France.

## Gear
I shoot on a Nikon D800 and I have the Nikon 16mm f2.8 fisheye, Nikon 24â€“70 f2.8 and Nikkor 50mm f1.4 lenses.

I use Adobe Photoshop with Camera Raw to process the images. HDR photos are treated using Photomatix HDR Pro.

## Terms
I respect you and your privacy as a visitor to my site. This is why I don't have any third party tracking scripts installed.

If you want to use any of my pictures then please let me know. Please don't steal them.

Thanks for visiting!
